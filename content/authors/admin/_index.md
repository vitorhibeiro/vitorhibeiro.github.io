    summary: |
      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## About Me
Aspiring scientist, passionate about Science and Technology, with a strong interest in data analysis and visualization.

I am currently pursuing a PhD project in the Department of Physics (PFI) at the State University of Maringá (UEM). My research is within the field of Complex Systems, focusing primarily on the concepts of Complex Networks and the Science of Science. The main goal of the project is to investigate the relationships between various metrics of Brazilian scientific production, particularly within the context of collaboration networks.
